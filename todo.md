How it will play:

you will have to clear the lock to start, or if you mess up or get lost
rotate clockwise 3 times

Then it will click when you get to the right number

you then have to change direction and go past than number

then it will click for the next right number

you then change direction again and go past that number

then it will click for the final number


if you go past the click, you have to start over, 3x rotate to clear


When you get a number right, it will show up on screen so you can reference it on the next try if you mess up.
You only get a number right if you don't overshoot and do at least 1 click in the opposite rotation
